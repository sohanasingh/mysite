I am an innovative scientist with over five years' of experience in data generation, management and analytics. I get excited by cool visualizations and using data to tell compelling stories. I am currently an assistant scientist specializing in genetics and bioinformatics at the Oceanographic Research Institute in Durban, South Africa. I am part of a team at the forefront of an exciting new project developing DNA metabarcoding as a tool for surveying marine biodiversity from whole communities of zooplankton on the east coast of South Africa.
