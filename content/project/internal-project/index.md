summary: The drifting larval phases of commercially important spiny lobsters, crabs, prawns and fishes form part of the marine zooplankton in the coastal waters of KZN. They are small (often microscopic), and often occur in very large numbers and very different types of species â€“ hence they are difficult and time-consuming to identify and count using a microscope and traditional sorting methods. Zooplankton abundance and species composition are vulnerable to changes in their environment, such as the strength and direction of ocean currents, and water temperature and chemistry, and they typically respond rapidly to these factors. The project will investigate DNA metabarcoding as a powerful new tool to assess the biodiversity of zooplankton, particularly in Marine Protected Areas. DNA metabarcoding is a molecular method that uses universal genetic markers to obtain information on the various sequences of DNA from all organisms in a sample, such as in the mix of plankton obtained from towing fine-mesh nets. The DNA is matched to reference (known) sequences stored on online databases, such as GenBank and the Barcode of Life. The presence and abundance of the different types of zooplankton in samples captured by these nets will be compared spatially (to identify areas with high abundance and species composition), seasonally (to determine pulses) and inter-annually (to determine long-term trends relative to environmental change).
