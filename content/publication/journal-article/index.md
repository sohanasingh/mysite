abstract: We report, for the first time in the wild, giant freshwater prawn *Macrobrachium
  rosenbergii* populations in East Africa. Specimens caught by fishermen in the lower
  reaches of the Ruvu River and Rufiji Delta in coastal Tanzania were identified based on their morphology, with confirmation through DNA barcode analysis. The East
  African specimens clustered with the western *M. rosenbergii dacqueti* subspecies
  in a phylogenetic analysis based on new and published mitochondrial 16S rRNA
  and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. Captured specimens spanned
  a size range of 110â€“310 mm total length and > 35% of females carried external
  eggs, implying that populations were established and self-sustaining. No active
  culture facilities or ponds with *M. rosenbergii* were found within the catchment.
  Nevertheless, the invasive populations supported a small-scale fishery that used
  bottom-set seine nets. The demonstrated presence of *M. rosenbergii* in at least two
  river systems, combined with the existence of favourable brackish water habitats
  for completing their life cycle, may indicate that river systems in East Africa are at
  a high risk of invasion by this species. Key information gaps for the region are highlighted.
