abstract: "Accurate species description in the marine environment is critical for estimating biodiversity and identifying genetically distinct stocks. Analysis of molecular data can potentially improve species delimitations because they are easily generated and independent, and yield consistent results with high statistical power. We used classical phylogenetic (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and coalescent-based methods (divergence dating with fossil calibrations and coalescent-based species delimitation) to resolve the phylogeny of the spiny lobster *Panulirus homarus* subspecies complex in the Indo-West Pacific. Analyses of mitochondrial data and combined nuclear and mitochondrial data recovered *Panulirus homarus homarus* and *Panulirus homarus rubellus* as separately evolving lineages, while the nuclear data trees were unresolved. Divergence dating analysis also identified *Panulirus homarus homarus* and *Panulirus homarus rubellus* as two distinct clades which diverged from a common ancestor during the Oligocene, approximately 26 million years ago. Species delimitation using coalescent-based methods corroborated these findings. A long pelagic larval life stage and the influence of ocean currents on post-larval settlement patterns suggest that a parapatric mode of speciation drives evolution in this subspecies complex. In combination, the results indicate that *Panulirus homarus rubellus* from the Southwest Indian Ocean is a separately evolving lineage and possibly a separate species."
